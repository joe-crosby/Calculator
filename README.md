This is a simple calculator that runs on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

There is a basic feature (default) and an advanced feature.
-The basic feature only allows a single operation at a time. The operation is calculated when operator key or the enter key is pressed.

-The advanced feature allows full expressions and grouping. (Grouping refers to the use of parenthesis to isolate an expression as it's own group.). All operations are calculated (in order of precedence) when the enter key is pressed.

-Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

The escape button will clear the screen and the delete and backspace buttons will remove the last character entered (While entering an expression).
